###Introduction


Telephone is a fun game for children, but a terrible way for adults to gather information. When threat intelligence practitioners rely on news reports for threat intelligence, they are playing telephone with information that can be critical to the security and safety of the entities they defend. As a report is re-summarized and regurgitated, meaning is corrupted and clarity gives way to vagueness. 

As time progresses, security threats will increase in severity. This is not hyperbole or fear mongering, but a fact that both nation states and cybercriminals have been investing more capital and manpower into attack capabilities. Defenders must keep pace with this escalation. However, if defenders rely mainly on the news for their decision-making, security will be stunted.

News is a readily available source of information. Upper management removed from the technical side of security is often most exposed to security news. However, the factors that go into making a good news story are not necessarily the same factors that go into making good research. It is important to be aware of the inherent biases and flaws that affect all news media due to the nature of the medium. To be blind to these issues is to be unaware of sources of error and bias in the information you consume.


###Why is this a bad practice?

News was never designed to be a tool to provide actionable threat intelligence. By definition, news reports are commenting on events that have happened in the past. Relying on news means that researchers will always be behind the pace of current events since they must wait for reporters to write and publish their pieces to take action. Articles that are published more quickly are more likely to have errors and therefore are less reliable, but high accuracy reports always take more time.

Media attention often focuses on the latest threat or malware, not necessarily the biggest issue. Media cycles often seize on trends that focus on page views instead of accuracy. Many threats are reported months after they have occurred and become popular in news cycles independent of real world risk. (EXAMPLE HERE). Researchers often report this to clients ad nauseam and believe this will prevent future attacks. However, attackers with customized malware tailor their attacks for each victim to prevent discovery by intrusion detection systems. This makes it highly unlikely that the same APT would affect two different companies after initial detection. There is also no guarantee media is focusing on the most important or timely industry trend. Relying on news stories for a perception of threats distorts client perspectives and can lead to poor decision-making.

News sources are classified in academia as secondary source or .meta analysis. because they are one step away from the primary, or original, source of information. Original sources often have the most accurate information and, for security specifically, can provide accurate listings of indicators of compromise. Although secondary sources can be useful to determine whether or note the original source is reliable, the original source of information should always be cited. As analysis moves farther away from the original source, the message becomes more biased and diluted. Some reporters and researchers have a tendency to leave out citations in their work. This is sometimes appealing because it gives the illusion of original research, but is highly frustrating for researchers trying to fact check or find the original source of the information. This is one of the main ways that information can become convoluted when information is transferred from source to source. Ideally, the person acting on threat intelligence should have information from as close to the original source as possible.


###What drives this trend?

Competition is fierce in the rapidly growing cyber security industry and companies feel compelled to produce data. Security consultants are often driven by the need to deliver a large volume of data and are not always given proper guidance on what constitutes valuable data. This results in a systemic glut of quantity over quality data. Producing high quality, real-time reports on every type of malware, threat actor, and network vulnerability that exists would require a phenomenally massive team of security experts that is not truly realistic. 

Security consultants struggle to accommodate client.s simultaneous desire for original information and speedy information. Threat researchers can engage much more granularly than news outlets, but media is what management sees on a daily basis. News articles are designed to spark interest and they can distract clients from what threats are truly important. Consultants need to emphasize the need to stay focused on relevant threats that are event-driven, rather than news driven. 

It is not surprisingly than many researchers have fallen into the news-based research trap. Since others in the industry participate in this trend, there is pressure on researchers to use news for fear of not producing if they do not utilize media. Even though clients ask for original and high-quality research, there is intense pressure to produce on a regular basis.

###Bad for Companies Internally and Externally

Companies are disadvantaged when researchers rely on news from an internal security perspective, but they also suffer holistically in terms of the bad habits the trend creates on an industry level. 

Corporations are aware that breaches make headlines and dread the day they may need to make a disclosure. The security community.s use of breach disclosures to provide services only provides another reason to fear revealing information. 

Fear of breach notifications can be harmful and lead to ill-advised decisions.  Public health research has repeatedly indicated that disease stigma decreases treatment rates. Extended to security, corporation.s fear and stigma of breaches likely prevents proper actions from being taken at the management level. Delayed or inadequate disclosures help no one and can directly result from fear of retribution. Companies that are perceived as waiting too long to disclose security breaches are often criticized. Conversely, companies are better received if they appear to fully release breach details. 

###Leaving News Based Research Behind

Researchers who rely on news for data may be intimidated to move away from media sources. However, there are many positive benefits to removing news from the research process. Sorting through and re-summarizing news articles is time consuming and the hours can be better used on other projects. Researchers can begin looking at other, higher quality sources of information and training themselves to employ more useful data mining techniques. There will be less information to deliver, but that is acceptable because the products will be inherently more valuable.

True value is found from notifications within a corporation.s network. Researchers who base their research off network alerts and internal notifications will find information that can alert them of a real threat. This is often the only way information can be found before an attack happens. Understanding the importance of this information and knowing how to react to it is how true threat intelligence is performed. 

Corporations should encourage contractors to move away from news-based researchers because it will enable them to see the true value of their vendors. Without the large volume of low quality news-related items, companies can see the actual differentiators that exist between vendors and judge services based on higher quality items. Valuable contractors may be able to alert their client if an internal event is meaningful before it hits the next news cycle. 




Without a constant focus on news-based research, security researchers can focus on more information that is relevant to their clients. Research should return to its roots as a creative process and leave the copycat work behind.
